    quote: "Reflecting on my journey from 2018 to the present, the NSA and ANC were initially distant echoes. However, stepping into the vibrant NSA Nkor Branch in July 2018 marked the start of an exciting chapter. Serving in various roles within the organization, from Secretary General to General Organizing Secretary, has been a transformative and enriching experience. The leadership of individuals like Dr. Ndiyun Robert and Mme Nkey Vandoline, along with the support of the Noni community, has deeply impacted my life, broadening my horizons and fostering a strong sense of belonging. I am profoundly grateful for the incredible journey with the Noni Students' Association.",
